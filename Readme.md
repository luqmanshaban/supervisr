# AI Article Analysis and Feedback

This project leverages Google's Generative AI to analyze essays and provide insightful summaries, highlight key findings, and suggest improvements. It utilizes an Express.js server for handling API requests and file uploads.

## Features

- **Essay Analysis**: Utilizes Google's Generative AI to analyze essays and generate insightful summaries.

- **Feedback Collection**: Accepts essays via file uploads or API requests, processes them, and appends the analysis feedback to a file.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Google Generative AI API key:
   ```env
   API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   ```

3. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/v1/articles**: Submit an essay for analysis. The essay should be included in the request body.

- **POST /file-upload**: Upload an essay file (supported format: txt). The server will return the uploaded file path, and the analysis feedback will be appended to a feedback file.

## Usage

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"article":"Your essay content here."}' http://localhost:3000/api/v1/articles
```
